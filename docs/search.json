They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. The data includes information on the treatment assignment, the response rate, the donation amount, and other variables. The data is in Stata format, so I will use the read_stata function from the pandas package to read the data into a pandas DataFrame. I had to truncate the data to remove missing values.

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper.

To do this, you will simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences.

This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample averages approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The distribution of average differences in donation amounts is centered around zero, indicating that the treatment and control groups have similar average donation amounts. the zero is slightly skewed towards the right. This suggests that the treatment group donated slightly more on average than the control group."

    "text": "Description\nThis Data is from a field experiment conducted by Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. The data includes information on the treatment assignment, the response rate, the donation amount, and other variables. The data is in Stata format, so I will use the read_stata function from the pandas package to read the data into a pandas DataFrame. I had to truncate the data to remove missing values.

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper.

In the linear regression, the coefficient on the treatment variable is .0074, and the p-value is .950. Both results are the same, and they are not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. This suggests that the treatment and control groups are balanced on the variable mrm2. The treatment has a negligible effect. This is consistent with the results in Table 1 of the paper, which shows that the treatment and control groups are balanced on all variables.\nt-test results: t-statistic = 0.062169999954557034 , p-value = 0.9504277199691156\n\n\nLinear regression results:\n\n\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.
