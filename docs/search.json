They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. The data includes information on the treatment assignment, the response rate, the donation amount, and other variables. The data is in Stata format, so I will use the read_stata function from the pandas package to read the data into a pandas DataFrame. I had to truncate the data to remove missing values.

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper.

To do this, you will simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results\nthe cumulative average difference in donation amounts approaches the true difference in means as the number of draws increases. This is consistent with the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the sample average approaches the true population average as the sample size increases.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results\nthe larger the sample size, the more the distribution of average differences in donation amounts approaches a normal distribution. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample averages approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The distribution of average differences in donation amounts is centered around zero, indicating that the treatment and control groups have similar average donation amounts. the zero is slightly skewed towards the right. This suggests that the treatment group donated slightly more on average than the control group."

They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. The data includes information on the treatment assignment, the response rate, the donation amount, and other variables. The data is in Stata format, so I will use the read_stata function from the pandas package to read the data into a pandas DataFrame. I had to truncate the data to remove missing values.

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable.

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader (Likert Plot, Binary Plot, Continious Plot). To do this, you will simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results\nthe cumulative average difference in donation amounts approaches the true difference in means as the number of draws increases. This is consistent with the Law of Large Numbers, which states that the sample average approaches the true population average as the sample size increases.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of Results\nthe larger the sample size, the more the distribution of average differences in donation amounts approaches a normal distribution. This is consistent with the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of sample averages approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The distribution of average differences in donation amounts is centered around zero, indicating that the treatment and control groups have similar average donation amounts. the zero is slightly skewed towards the right. This suggests that the treatment group donated slightly more on average than the control group."
